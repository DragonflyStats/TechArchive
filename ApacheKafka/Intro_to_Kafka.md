## Introduction to Apache Kafka

* Apache Kafka is an open-source stream processing software platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds. 

* Its storage layer is essentially a "massively scalable pub/sub message queue architected as a distributed transaction log,"[3] making it highly valuable for enterprise infrastructures to process streaming data. 

* Additionally, Kafka connects to external systems (for data import/export) via Kafka Connect and provides Kafka Streams, a Java stream processing library.

* The design is heavily influenced by transaction logs
