Boltzmann Machines
==============================
A Boltzmann machine is a type of stochastic recurrent neural network invented by Geoffrey Hinton and Terry Sejnowski. Boltzmann machines can be seen as the stochastic, generative counterpart of Hopfield nets. They were one of the first examples of a neural network capable of learning internal representations, and are able to represent and (given sufficient time) solve difficult combinatoric problems. However, due to a number of issues discussed below, Boltzmann machines with unconstrained connectivity have not proven useful for practical problems in machine learning or inference. They are still theoretically intriguing, however, due to the locality and Hebbian nature of their training algorithm, as well as their parallelism and the resemblance of their dynamics to simple physical processes. If the connectivity is constrained, the learning can be made efficient enough to be useful for practical problems.
