\subsection{Bayesian Networks}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------%
Bayesian Networks, also known as belief networks, are probabilistic graphical models, that
represent a set of variables and their probabilistic interdependencies.

For example, a Bayesian Network could represent the probabilistic relationship between
diseases and symptoms.

Formally, Bayesian Networks are Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAGs) whose nodes represent variables, and whose arcs encode
conditional interdependencies between variables.
