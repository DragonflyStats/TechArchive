Neural Networks Syllabus
================================
- The artificial neuron; network architecture; perceptrons. 
- Single layer networks; supervised training in batch and individual mode. 
- Multilayer feedforward networks; backpropogation; momentum. 
- Counterpropogation networks; unsupervised training; initialisation of weights. 
- Statistical methods; Boltzmann training. 
- Feedback networks; Hopfields nets; energy; training. 
- Applications. 
- Additional software requirements: recommended that some neural nets software is obtained (eg MATLAB).
