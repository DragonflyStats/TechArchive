The Bourne shell is a shell, or command-line interpreter, for computer operating systems.

The Bourne shell was the default shell for Version 7 Unix and for most Unix-like systems for many years thereafter until the sh language eventually got specified by POSIX.2 (1992) and most systems eventually replaced their sh with a compliant shell (which the Bourne shell was not).

Developed by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs, it was a replacement for the Thompson shell, whose executable file had the same nameâ€”sh. It was released in 1977 in the Version 7 Unix release distributed to colleges and universities. Although it is used as an interactive command interpreter, it was also intended as a scripting language and contains most of the features that are commonly considered to produce structured programs.
