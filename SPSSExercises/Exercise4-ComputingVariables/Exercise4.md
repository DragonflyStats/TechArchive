Exercise 4 : Deriving New Variables
=========================================

### DataSet 

For this exercise we will use the "Measurements" data set.
This data set comprises three key variables:

1. Sex
2. Height
3. Weight.

### Exercise 1

The first exercise is to create a new variable, called ***heightcat***, for categorizing heights.

1 . Short
2 . Average
3 . Tall

The values must be labelled.

### Exercise 2


In this exercise we create a derived variable called ***BMI***, which is based on Height and Weight.

This variable is numeric, and does not require value labels.

### Exercise 3


In this exercise we create a derived variable called ***BMIcat***, which is based on BMI and Sex.
