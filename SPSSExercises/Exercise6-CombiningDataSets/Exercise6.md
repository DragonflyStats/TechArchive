Exercise 6 : joining Two Tables
=========================================

### DataSet 

For this exercise we will use the "Measurements" and "diet" data set.

Remark: It is sufficient to use the raw data sets, as provided. This exercise can be completed if you completed other exercises with new variables added to one of both of the data sets.

In both data sets, there is a unique identifier for each person. This type of variable is known as a **Primary Key**.

### Exercise 1

Before we can merge these two data sets, we must have them both sorted by the ID variable.

### Exercise 2


In this exercise we join the two data sets into a single table.

### Exercise 3

For how many cases are we missing Measurements?
For how many cases are we missing diet data?
