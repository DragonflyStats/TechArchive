The FASTCLUS Procedure
=========================
- performs a disjoint cluster analysis on the basis of distances computed from one or more quantitative variables
- observations are divided into clusters such that every observation belongs to one and only one cluster
- uses Euclidean distances, so the cluster centers are based on least squares estimation (k-means model)
- designed to find good clusters (but not necessarily the best possible clusters) with only two or three passes through the data set
- can be an effective procedure for detecting outliers because outliers often appear as clusters with only one member
