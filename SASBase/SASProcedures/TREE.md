The TREE Procedure
=====================
- produces a tree diagram, also known as a dendrogram or phenogram, from a data set created by the CLUSTER or VARCLUS procedure that contains the results of hierarchical clustering as a tree structure
- produces a diagram of the tree structure that is oriented vertically, with the root at the top, or the diagram can be oriented horizontally, with the root at the left
- obtain separate analyses on observations in groups
- uses ODS to create a SAS data set corresponding to any table
