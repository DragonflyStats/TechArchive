Multivariate Regression Analysis
=========================================
As the name implies, multivariate regression is a technique that estimates a single regression model with multiple outcome variables and one or more predictor variables.

Please Note: The purpose of this page is to show how to use various data analysis commands. It does not cover all aspects of the research process which researchers are expected to do. In particular, it does not cover data cleaning and checking, verification of assumptions, model diagnostics and potential follow-up analyses.

###Examples of multivariate regression analysis

- Example 1. A researcher has collected data on three psychological variables, four academic variables (standardized test scores), and the type of educational program the student is in for 600 high school students. She is interested in how the set of psychological variables relate to the academic variables and gender. In particular, the researcher is interested in how many dimensions are necessary to understand the association between the two sets of variables.

- Example 2. A doctor has collected data on cholesterol, blood pressure and weight.  She also collected data on the eating habits of the subjects (e.g., how many ounces of red meat, fish, dairy products, and chocolate consumed per week).  She wants to investigate the relationship between the three measures of health and eating habits.

- Example 3. A researcher is interested in determining what factors influence the health African Violet plants.  She collects data on the average leaf diameter, the mass of the root ball, and the average diameter of the blooms, as well as how long the plant has been in the current container.  For predictor variables, she measures several elements in the soil, in addition to the amount of light and water each plant receives.
