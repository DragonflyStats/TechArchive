SAS Base Part 3


\subsection*{Comments}
You can insert comments into a SAS program to document the purpose of the program, to 
explain segments of the program, or to describe the steps in a complex program or calculation.
There are two forms of comment statement
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
*text*
/* test */
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
SAS ignores text between comment symbols during processing.
Important: avoid placing the /* comment symbols in columns 1 or 2.Some operating systems would interpret that
as a request to end the sas job.

\subsection*{Common Problems}

\begin{itemize}
\item[1] Missing Run Statements
\item[2] Missing Semi-Colon
\item[3] Unbalanced Quotation Marks
\item[4] Invalid Options
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Missing Semi-Colon}
If a semi-colon is omitted at the end of a statement, SAS reads the statement as one long statement.
The SAS log then lists errors that related to the combined statement, not the actual mistake.
