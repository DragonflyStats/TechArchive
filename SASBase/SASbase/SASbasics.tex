Proc SQL

PROC SQL is the SAS implementation of the Standard Query Language (SQL) standard to
work with databases and is used in Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access and other
database systems. PROC SQL is a powerful language that allows sophisticated merges. 
When you merge datasets with PROC SQL you do not need to sort them.

PROC SQL;
CREATE TABLE temp2 AS SELECT
inanames.coname, inanames.iname, temp.*
FROM temp, comp.inanames
WHERE temp.cnum=inanames.cnum AND temp.cic=inanames.cic;
QUIT;
