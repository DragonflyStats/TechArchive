Create a Shiny App Powered by a Neo4j Database.
=====================================================
Shiny is my new favorite thing from RStudio. It’s a web framework for R, which is nice for someone like me with little web development experience. The tutorial and gallery pages are a good place to start.

At its most basic, a Shiny app consists of a ui.R file and a server.R file in the same directory, which was all that I needed to create this app. You can use any R package that is on CRAN or GitHub in Shiny, so I am able to use RNeo4j to connect to a Neo4j database within my app.

I have a small database of Dallas Fort-Worth Airport (DFW) restaurants stored in Neo4j. It has the following structure:
<pre><code>
   This          To     That
1  Gate IN_TERMINAL Terminal
2 Place IN_CATEGORY Category
3 Place     AT_GATE     Gate
</code></pre>
For example, here is a visualization of terminal A:



The DFW data ships as a sample dataset with RNeo4j, so you can import it with importSample:
<pre><code>
library(RNeo4j)
graph = startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data/")
importSample(graph, "dfw")
</code></pre>
For my app, I simply wanted to be able to select an arbitrary number of restaurant categories in a certain terminal and order the results by absolute distance from a given gate number. This is really easy to do with the Shiny widgets, whose selections I pass as parameters to a Cypher query.

Before developing, you’ll need to install the shiny package with:
<pre><code>
install.packages("shiny")
</code></pre>
Below are my ui.R and server.R files, which are pretty easy to follow once you’ve read through the Shiny tutorial.
<pre><code>
ui.R

library(shiny)
library(RNeo4j)

# Connect to the Neo4j DB.
graph = startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data/")

# Get categories and terminals.
categories = getLabeledNodes(graph, "Category")
categories = sapply(categories, function(c) c$name)

terminals = getLabeledNodes(graph, "Terminal")
terminals = sapply(terminals, function(t) t$name)

# Build UI.
shinyUI(fluidPage(
  titlePanel("DFW Food & Drink Finder"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      strong("Show me food & drink places in the following categories"),
      checkboxGroupInput("categories",
                         label = "",
                         choices = categories,
                         selected = sample(categories, 3)),
      strong("closest to gate"),
      numericInput("gate", 
                   label = "", 
                   value = sample(1:30, 1)),
      br(),
      strong("in terminal"),
      selectInput("terminal", 
                  label = "", 
                  choices = terminals,
                  selected = sample(terminals, 1)),
      "Powered by", a("Neo4j", 
                      href = "http://www.neo4j.org/",
                      target = "_blank")
    ),
    mainPanel(
      tableOutput("restaurants")
    )
  )
))
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
server.R

library(shiny)
library(RNeo4j)

graph = startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data/")

query = "
MATCH (p:Place)-[:IN_CATEGORY]->(c:Category),
      (p)-[:AT_GATE]->(g:Gate),
      (g)-[:IN_TERMINAL]->(t:Terminal)
WHERE c.name IN {categories} AND t.name = {terminal}
WITH c, p, g, t, ABS(g.gate - {gate}) AS dist
ORDER BY dist
RETURN p.name AS Name, c.name AS Category, g.gate AS Gate, t.name AS Terminal
"

shinyServer(function(input, output) {
  output$restaurants <- renderTable({
    data = cypher(graph, 
                  query,
                  categories = as.list(input$categories),
                  terminal = input$terminal,
                  gate = input$gate)
    return(data)
  })
}
)
</code></pre>
In server.R, each input is referenced by whatever you named it in ui.R. In ui.R, each output is referenced by whatever you named it in server.R. Again, the Shiny tutorials and articles explain all of this very well. Each time the user changes one of the inputs, the code inside renderTable() is re-run to update the output according to the user’s new inputs.

### Running your App
To view your app locally in a browser:
<pre><code>
runApp("dir")
</code></pre>
"dir" is your app’s directory (where you have server.R and ui.R sitting). You can update both ui.R and server.R while runApp() is working and view your changes by refreshing the page.

To deploy your app and host it at shinyapps.io, you’ll need to create an account there and follow their directions. You’ll also want to install the shinyapps package with:
<pre><code>
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/shinyapps")
</code></pre>
To deploy your app:

library(shinyapps)
deployApp("dir")
While my app only returns a table, you can easily create a dashboard-like analytics tool for any Neo4j database in Shiny. The Shiny gallery has a lot of good examples of highly-interactive charts and maps.
