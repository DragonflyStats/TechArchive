Spark Architecture
============================
Spark Architecture includes following three main components:

1. Data Storage
2. API
3. Management Framework
Letâ€™s look at each of these components in more detail.

### 1. Data Storage:

Spark uses HDFS file system for data storage purposes. It works with any Hadoop compatible data source including HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, etc.

### 2. API:

The API provides the application developers to create Spark based applications using a standard API interface. Spark provides API for Scala, Java, and Python programming languages.

There are Spark APIs for each of these languages.

* Scala API
* Java
* Python

### Resource Management:

Spark can be deployed as a Stand-alone server or it can be on a distributed computing framework like Mesos or YARN.
