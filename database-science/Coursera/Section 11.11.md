Constraints and Triggers
========================================================
Video 11.1 Motivations

- Constraints (Integrity)
- impose restriction
- structural and type restrictions

### Example
Grade Point Average is between 0 and 4.0 
(i.e. 0 < G.P.A < 4.0 


- catch data entry errors
- correctness criteria for UPDATES
- Enforce consistency
- tell the system about the data (i.e key constraints)

#### Types of constraint: 
Non-Null constraint
key constraint
referential integrity (Foreign Key Constraint)
Attribute Based Constraint

Declaring and Enforcing Constraints
Deferred Constraint Checking
