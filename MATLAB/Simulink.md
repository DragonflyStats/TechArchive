Simulink, developed by MathWorks, is a data flow graphical programming language tool for modeling, simulating and analyzing multidomain dynamic systems. Its primary interface is a graphical block diagramming tool and a customizable set of block libraries.

SimulinkÂ offers tight integration with the rest of the MATLAB environment and can either drive MATLAB or be scripted from it. Simulink is widely used in control theory and digital signal processing for multidomain simulation and Model-Based Design
