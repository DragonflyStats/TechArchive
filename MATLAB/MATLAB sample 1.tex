Answer all of the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Compute the sum of all two-digit prime numbers

\item Compute the sum of the squares of all prime numbers less than 100.

\item Specifying which approach you have used, evaluate the following

 \[ \mbox{Log}_{10}(432) \]

\item How many three-digit prime numbers are there?

\item Compute the mean, median and standard deviation of the set of three digit numbers.
(For this exercise, you may treat the set of numbers as a randomly selected sample).

\item What are the unique factors of the number 719423423?
