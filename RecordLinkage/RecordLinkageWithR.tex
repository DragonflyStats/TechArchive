Abstract Record linkage deals with detecting
homonyms and mainly synonyms in data. The
package RecordLinkage provides means to perform and evaluate different record linkage methods.
A stochastic framework is implemented which calculates weights through an EM algorithm.
The determination of the necessary thresholds in this model can be achieved by tools
of extreme value theory. Furthermore, machine
learning methods are utilized, including decision
trees (rpart), bootstrap aggregating (bagging),
ada boost (ada), neural nets (nnet) and
support vector machines (svm). The generation
of record pairs and comparison patterns from
single data items are provided as well. Comparison
patterns can be chosen to be binary or
based on some string metrics. In order to reduce
computation time and memory usage, blocking
can be used. Future development will concentrate
on additional and refined methods, performance
improvements and input/outp
